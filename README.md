# Service Provider: OTEL Collector

An [OpenMCP](https://github.com/openmcp-project) Service Provider that automates the deployment and lifecycle management of [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) instances into Managed Control Planes (MCPs).

## Overview

This service provider installs an OpenTelemetry Collector into each MCP that requests one. Instead of generating or templating the collector configuration, it follows a **bring-your-own-config** approach: the user provides the full OTEL collector configuration via a ConfigMap and any credentials via a generic Secret directly in the MCP. All secret keys are injected as environment variables into the collector container and can be referenced in the OTEL config using `${env:KEY_NAME}`. The service provider waits for both resources to exist, then deploys the collector.

### Architecture

```
Platform Cluster                  MCP (per tenant)
┌─────────────────────┐           ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  ProviderConfig     │           │  namespace: observability        │
│  (cluster-scoped)   │           │                                  │
│  - defaultImage     │           │  ConfigMap: otel-collector-conf  │ ← user creates
│  - defaultVersion   │           │  Secret: otel-collector-secret   │ ← user creates
│  - imagePullSecrets │           │                                  │
└─────────────────────┘           │  Deployment: otel-collector      │ ← SP creates
                                  │  Service: otel-collector         │ ← SP creates
Onboarding Cluster                └──────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────┐
│  OtelCollectorService│ ← one per MCP
│  (per-MCP overrides) │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Reconciliation Flow

1. Set status to `Progressing`
2. Ensure the target namespace exists in the MCP
3. Sync image pull secrets from the platform cluster to the MCP (if configured)
4. **Check prerequisites** — does ConfigMap `otel-collector-conf` and Secret `otel-collector-secret` exist?
   - **No** — stay `Progressing` ("Waiting for ConfigMap and Secret"), requeue after 30s
   - **Yes** — continue
5. Create/update the Deployment (referencing the user-provided ConfigMap and Secret)
6. Create/update the ClusterIP Service (ports 4317, 4318, 8888)
7. Set status to `Ready`

On **deletion**, the service provider removes the Deployment and Service but leaves the user-managed ConfigMap and Secret intact.

### Config Change Detection

The service provider computes a SHA-256 hash of both the ConfigMap and Secret data and stores it as a pod template annotation (`otelcollector.services.openmcp.cloud/config-hash`). When either resource changes, the hash changes on the next reconciliation, which triggers a rolling restart of the collector pods to pick up the new configuration.

## API

### OtelCollectorService (onboarding cluster)

Created per MCP to request an OTEL collector installation. All fields are optional overrides — defaults come from the ProviderConfig.

```yaml
apiVersion: otelcollector.services.openmcp.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: OtelCollectorService
metadata:
  name: my-mcp
spec:
  # All fields are optional — defaults from ProviderConfig are used if omitted
  collectorImage: "otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib"
  collectorVersion: "0.146.1"
  namespace: "observability"
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "200m"
      memory: "256Mi"
    limits:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "512Mi"
```

### ProviderConfig (platform cluster)

Cluster-scoped resource that provides default values for all MCPs.

```yaml
apiVersion: otelcollector.services.openmcp.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: otelcollectorservice
spec:
  pollInterval: 1m
  defaultImage: "otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib"
  defaultVersion: "0.146.1"
  defaultNamespace: "observability"
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: my-registry-secret
  defaultResources:
    requests:
      cpu: "200m"
      memory: "256Mi"
```

## Prerequisites in the MCP

The service provider **does not create or manage** these resources. They must be created by the user or another system directly in the MCP before the collector can be deployed.

### ConfigMap: `otel-collector-conf`

Contains the full OpenTelemetry Collector configuration under the key `otel-collector-config`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-conf
  namespace: observability
data:
  otel-collector-config: |
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
          http:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
    processors:
      batch: {}
    exporters:
      debug:
        verbosity: detailed
    extensions:
      health_check:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:13133
    service:
      extensions: [health_check]
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [debug]
```

> **Important:** The `health_check` extension on port 13133 is **required**. The service provider configures liveness and readiness probes that check this endpoint. Without it, the collector pods will be continuously restarted by Kubernetes.

### Secret: `otel-collector-secret`

Contains credentials or other sensitive values needed by the collector. All keys from this secret are injected as environment variables into the collector container via `envFrom`. You can reference them in your OTEL config using the collector's `${env:KEY_NAME}` syntax.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-secret
  namespace: observability
type: Opaque
stringData:
  TOKEN_URL: "https://your-auth-server.example.com/oauth/token"
  CLIENT_ID: "your-client-id"
  CLIENT_SECRET: "your-client-secret"
  API_KEY: "your-api-key"
```

Then reference them in the ConfigMap config:

```yaml
extensions:
  oauth2client:
    client_id: "${env:CLIENT_ID}"
    client_secret: "${env:CLIENT_SECRET}"
    token_url: "${env:TOKEN_URL}"
exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: https://my-endpoint
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${env:API_KEY}"
```

## Exposed Ports

The collector Deployment and Service expose:

| Port | Protocol | Name | Purpose |
|------|----------|------|---------|
| 4317 | TCP | otlp-grpc | OTLP gRPC receiver |
| 4318 | TCP | otlp-http | OTLP HTTP receiver |
| 8888 | TCP | metrics | Collector internal metrics |

Health probes use port 13133 (the collector's built-in `health_check` extension).
